/** No `frozenParties` here, unlike the real adapter's marshal. Freezing a
 * submitted notification's addresses happens in the backend at submit, and the
 * stub has no address-book resolution to do it with — so a submitted journey in
 * stub mode still resolves its references live. The check-answers controller
 * falls back to live resolution when `frozenParties` is absent, so stub mode
 * behaves exactly as it did before the freeze existed.
 *
 * Worth knowing before concluding the freeze is broken: verify it against the
 * real adapter (E2E or a local stack), not the stub. */
